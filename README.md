This is a translation application made with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. While this was a tutorial project, I added some extra features to make it more acessible, especially for those learning a new language!

The application uses a free API and allows users to translate to a large selection of languages.

It also includes a button to save the inputted/outputted text to your computer's clipboard, as well as a button for speech.

When I was learning to build this application, I noticed that speech speed was a little fast, which would be difficult for people learning a new language. Therefore, as an added bonus, I made a range slider which would allow users to adjust the spoken speech. The minimum speed is 0.1 while the maximum is 1 and the default is 1 since it is the default for <code>Window.speechSynthesis</code>.
